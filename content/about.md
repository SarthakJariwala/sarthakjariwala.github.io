**Sr. Software Engineer** at [Twelve](https://twelve.co). Before that I was a **Research Scientist** at [Palo Alto Research Center (PARC)](https://www.parc.com)

I work at the intersection of **software and hardware interfaces, materials, and machine learning**.

I combine my expertise in these areas to solve scientific problems and commercial challenges.

I have [published](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=E2ixgRrcZfsC&hl=en&oi=ao) **10+ peer-reviewed articles in leading materials and energy journals.**

I also have **extensive experience developing software tools and libraries**. You can check out my **open-source libraries and tools** [here](/open-source-software).

I have significant experience in expertly communicating complex information to stakeholders and technical & general audience, and in providing actionable insights from data collected and critically analyzed with scientific rigor.
