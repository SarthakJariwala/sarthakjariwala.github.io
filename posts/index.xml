Is solar energy a viable resource for a city like Seattle? My friend recently asked me this question. I believe it&amp;rsquo;s a fair question to ask. Seattle isn&amp;rsquo;t known for its abundance of sunshine. As I write this post, it is a gloomy, cloudy and rainy day in Seattle. For those familiar with Seattle weather, this is not a surprise - fall and winter months are often cloudy and rainy.</description></item><item><title>Attractive, Effective &amp; Descriptive Image Visualization in Python</title><link>https://sarthakjariwala.github.io/posts/introducing-seaborn-image/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Feb 2021 09:56:20 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://sarthakjariwala.github.io/posts/introducing-seaborn-image/</guid><description>Add scalebars, visualize image distribution, correct outliers, and more.
This post introduces some of the functionalities in seaborn-image for descriptive, effective and attractive image visualization.
Seaborn-image is an open source python visualization library for images built on top of matplotlib. It aims to provide a high level API to visualize image data similar to how seaborn provides high level API to visualize tabular data. As the name suggests, seaborn-image is heavily inspired by the seaborn library.</description></item><item><title>Effective Visualization of Multi-Dimension Image Data in Python</title><link>https://sarthakjariwala.github.io/posts/multi-dimension-image-data/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Feb 2021 18:59:05 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://sarthakjariwala.github.io/posts/multi-dimension-image-data/</guid><description>Multi-dimensional image data is, generally speaking, cumbersome to visualize.
In scientific imaging (or in most imaging areas), multi-dimensional images are very common. The additional dimension could be anything from the physical 3rd dimension (&amp;ldquo;Z axis&amp;rdquo;), where 2D images are taken at different depths; to the time dimension, where 2D images are taken at different time intervals; to different channels in scientific imaging instruments such as atomic force microscopes or in RGB images.</description></item></channel></rss>
